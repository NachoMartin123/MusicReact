TEST
    - UNIT TEST:  A unit might be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object. A unit test isolates a section of code and verifies its correctness
    - COMPONENT TEST: Tests are performed on each component in isolation from other components. Generally, React applications are made up of several components, so component testing deals with testing these components individually.
    - SNAPSHOT TEST: A snapshot test makes sure that the user interface (UI) of a web application does not change unexpectedly. It captures the code of a component at a moment in time, so that we can compare the component in one state with any other possible state it might take.
